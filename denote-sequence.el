;;; Commentary:

;; Sequence notes extension for Denote.  It uses the SIGNATURE file
;; name component of Denote to establish a hierarchy between notes.
;; As such, note 1=1 is the child of the note 1.  The rest of the
;; Denote file naming scheme continues to apply as described in the
;; manual, as do all the other features of Denote.
;;
;; A new sequence note can be of the type `parent', `child', and
;; `sibling'.  For the convenience of the user, we provide commands to
;; create such "sequence notes", link only between them (as opposed to
;; a link to any other file with the Denote file-naminng scheme), and
;; re-parent them on demand.
;;
;; All the relevant functions we provide take care to automatically
;; use the right number for a given sequence.  If, for example, we
;; create a new child for parent 1=1, we make sure that it is the new
;; largest number among any existing children, so if 1=1=1 already
;; exists we use 1=1=2, and so on.
;;
;; This optional extension is not necessary for such a workflow.
;; Users can always define whatever SIGNATURE they want manually.  The
;; purpose of this extension is to streamline that work.

;;; Code:

;; NOTE 2024-12-25: Right now I am hardcoding the = as a field
;; separator inside of the Denote signature.  This is the default
;; behaviour, though we provide the `denote-file-name-slug-functions'
;; which, in principle, make the separator anything the user wants.
;; If we can accommodate such open-endedness, then I am happy to make
;; the relevant changes, but I prefer to keep it restricted at this
;; early stage.
;;
;; Similarly, I am not giving the option for Luhmann-style sequences
;; that include numbers and letters.  Ours consist only of numbers,
;; since (i) it is simpler and (ii) we already have the field
;; separator to give a sufficient sense of place.

;; TODO 2025-01-08: Test whether the built-in hierarchy.el can be used
;; to present the sequences in a nice way.  What do we need and how
;; exactly do we use that library.
